# KelloCharts for Android
Kotlin Charts/graphs library for Android compatible with API 21+ (Android 5.0), several chart types with support for scaling, scrolling and animations
Works best when hardware acceleration is available, so API 14+(Android 4.0) is recommended.

# Build badges and gradle availability coming soon

## Features

 - Line chart(cubic lines, filled lines, scattered points)
 - Column chart(grouped, stacked, negative values)
 - Pie chart
 - Bubble chart
 - Combo chart(columns/lines)
 - Preview charts(for column chart and line chart)
 - Zoom(pinch to zoom, double tap zoom), scroll and fling
 - Custom and auto-generated axes(top, bottom, left, right, inside)
 - Animations

## Screens and Demos

 - Code of a demo application is in `kellocharts-sample` directory 
 - Demo App coming soon

## Usage

Every chart view can be defined in layout xml file:

 ```xml
    <co.csadev.kellocharts.view.LineChartView
        android:id="@+id/chart"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />
 ```

 or created in code and added to layout later:

 ```Kotlin
    val chart = new LineChartView(context)
    layout.addView(chart)
 ```

 Use methods from *Chart classes to define chart behaviour, example methods:

 ```Kotlin
    Chart.isInteractive = isInteractive
    Chart.zoomType = zoomType
    Chart.setContainerScrollEnabled(isEnabled, scrollType)
 ```

 Use methods from data models to define how chart looks like, example methods:

 ```Kotlin
    ChartData.axisXBottom = axisX
    ColumnChartData.isStacked = isStacked
    Line.strokeWidth = strokeWidthDp
 ```

 Every chart has its own method to set chart data and its own data model, example for line chart:

 ```Kotlin
    arrayListOf(PointValue(0, 2), PointValue(1, 4), PointValue(2, 3), PointValue(3, 4))

    val line = Line(values, color = Color.BLUE, isCubic = true)
    val lines = arrayListOf(line)

    val data = LineChartData(lines)

    val chart = LineChartView(context)
    chart.lineChartData = data
 ```

 Also, available as a DSL, same example as above:

 ```Kotlin
lineData {
    lines {
        line {
            color = Color.BLUE
            isCubic = true
            pointValues {
                point {
                    x = 0f
                    y = 2f
                }
                point {
                    x = 1f
                    y = 4f
                }
                point {
                    x = 2f
                    y = 3f
                }
                point {
                    x = 3f
                    y = 4f
                }
            }
        }
    }
 }
 ```

 After the chart data has been set you can still modify its attributes but right after that you should call
 `*.*ChartData` setter again to let chart recalculate and redraw data. There is also an option to use copy constructor for deep copy of
 chart data. You can safely modify copy in other threads and pass it to `*.*ChartData` setter later.
